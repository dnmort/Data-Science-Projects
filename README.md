# Data-Science-Projects

This repository holds my data science projects, including:
- My main portfolio project: **Regression Models for Predicting Commodity Sales Prices**
- Various projects I completed while in the BrainStation Online Bootcamp (brainstation.io): **BrainStation Projects**
- Various projects I completed on DataCamp (datacamp.com): **DataCamp Projects**


## Regression Models for Predicting Commodity Sales Prices

This folder contains all of the files relevant to my BrainStation Capstone Project:
***Regression Models for Predicting Commodity Sales Prices***
by Daniel Mortensen

### Subfolder Layout
- Raw data is stored in the "./Data" subfolder.

- All dataframes generated during the importing, cleaning, exploring, or other analysis steps are stored in the "./DataFrames" subfolder.

- Requirements for setting up the different kernels used in this project are stored in the "./kernel requirements" subfolder.

- PDF printouts of the Jupyter notebooks used for this project are stored in the "./PDF Versions of Notebook Files" subfolder.

### Project Notebooks
- "Data Scrubbing.ipynb": used for scrubbing and combining corn, market, and climate data into unified dataframes and for engineering a baseline feature.

- "Data Visualization and Exploratory Analysis.ipynb": used for visualizing the various features and exploring their relevance to the target feature, "PRICE RECEIVED, MEASURED IN $ / BU".

- "Modeling.ipynb": used for testing various machine learning regression models for predicting the target feature, "PRICE RECEIVED, MEASURED IN $ / BU".

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank all of my BrainStation instructors for their support on this project. I would also like to thank my wife and children for their patience as I've taught myself a little data science.


## BrainStation Projects
![BrainStation Logo](/assets/BrainStation_Primary_Logo.png)
This folder contains projects I completed while in the BrainStation Online Bootcamp (brainstation.io).

These projects showcase skills I have developed in Data Science, including:

- **Data Analysis in SQL**: *Bixi Project - Part 1*
- **Visual Analytics in Tableau**: *Bixi Project - Part 2*
- **Cleaning and EDA**: *Statistics & Public Health 1*
- **Data Analysis**: *Statistics & Public Health 2*
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Wrangling**: *Natural Language Processing With Hotel Review Part 1*
- **Modeling**: *Natural Language Processing With Hotel Review Part 2*
- **Big Data Fundamentals**: *Big Data Wrangling With Google Books Ngrams*


## DataCamp Projects
![DataCamp Logo](/assets/datacamp.png)
This folder contains projects I completed on DataCamp (datacamp.com). 

These projects showcase skills I have developed in Data Science.

- Guided: projects with detailed instructions and tests for checking results.
- Unguided: projects with relatively few instructions and no preprogrammed tests.

*Note*: these projects are pdf copies of the projects completed on DataCamp. Not all of the content, especially that found in the markdwon cells, is my original work.
