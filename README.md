- **Guided**: projects with detailed instructions and tests for checking results.
- **Unguided**: projects with relatively few instructions.

This folder contains all of the files relevant to my BrainStation Capstone Project:
***Regression Models for Predicting Commodity Sales Prices***
by Daniel Mortensen

### Subfolder Layout
- Raw data is stored in the "./Data" subfolder.
- All dataframes generated during the importing, cleaning, exploring, or other analysis steps are stored in the "./DataFrames" subfolder.
- Requirements for setting up the different kernels used in this project are stored in the "./kernel requirements" subfolder.
- PDF printouts of the Jupyter notebooks used for this project are stored in the "./PDF Versions of Notebook Files" subfolder.

### Project Notebooks
- "Data Scrubbing.ipynb": used for scrubbing and combining corn, market, and climate data into unified dataframes and for engineering a baseline feature.
- "Data Visualization and Exploratory Analysis.ipynb": used for visualizing the various features and exploring their relevance to the target feature, "PRICE RECEIVED, MEASURED IN $ / BU".
- "Modeling.ipynb": used for testing various machine learning regression models for predicting the target feature, "PRICE RECEIVED, MEASURED IN $ / BU".
