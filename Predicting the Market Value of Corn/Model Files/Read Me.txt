This folder contains all of the files relevant to my BrainStation Capstone Project:
Predicting the Market Value of Corn
by Daniel Mortensen


Here I will describe the data structure and purpose of this folder and its subfolders and contents.


# The "Refrences" Jupyter notebook simply contains the references for the data used in this project.


# There are two subfolders for this project:
- "Raw Data & Cleaning"
- "Data Modelling"


# "Raw Data & Cleaning" contains 2 subfolders, 3 Jupyter notebooks, and 3 csv files:
	- Subfolders:
		- "Corn Data", which contains raw data files in csv format containing all the data on corn for the years 1950 to 2021, downloaded from quickstats.nass.usda.gov\.
		- "Climate Data", which contains raw weather data for the years 1950 to 2020, downloaded from ncdc.noaa.gov.

	- Jupyter notebooks:
		- "Corn Data Prep and Filtering": this notebook was used to combine all of the corn data and then clean it and export it as a csv formatted for easy data frame creation later.
		- "Climate Data Prep and Filtering": the name of this notebook is slightly misleading. This notebook was used to reformat the climate data, combine it into a single data frame, and export is as a csv for later analysis.
		- "Combining Data and Exporting": this notebook was used to seperate the corn data into two data frames, both containing data collected on a national level. One data frame was for data collected annually and the other was for data collected monthly. The climate and US population data were then added to these data frames, and the data frames were exported as csv files to the "Data Modelling" folder.


	- CSV Files:
		- "compiled_corn_df.csv": This is the combined and filtered corn data frame generated in the "Corn Data Prep and Filtering" Jupyter notebook.
		- "climate.csv": This is the combined climate data frame generated in the "Climate Data Prep and Filtering" Jupyter notebook.
		- "USPop.csv": Contains the US population from years 1950 to 2020, downloaded from multpl.com. 


# "Data Modelling" contains 2 Jupyter notebooks, and 3 csv files:
	- Jupyter notebooks:
		- "National Month Initial Modelling": This notebook was used to analyze the monthly data. The main result of this analysis was the determination of monthly deviations from annual average sales prices.
		- "Final Model": This notebook was used to generate the final annual and monthly models for predicting annual corn sales prices.

	- CSV Files:
		- "nat_year.csv": This file contains the data frame for corn data collected nationally on an annual time scale, generated in the "Combining Data and Exporting" notebook.
		- "nat_month.csv": This file contains the data frame for corn data collected nationally on a monthly time scale, generated in the "Combining Data and Exporting" notebook.
		- "monthly_deviations.csv": This file contains information on how prices fluctuate month to month relative to the annual sales prices. This file was generated from the "National Month Initial Modelling" notebook.
