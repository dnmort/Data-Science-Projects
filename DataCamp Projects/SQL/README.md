# SQL Projects (DataCamp)  
![SQL Logo](../../assets/SQL.png)  
This folder contains projects I completed on DataCamp ([datacamp.com](datacamp.com)) using **SQL**  
(SQL server, in a Jupyter Notebook)

These are **Guided** projects, with detailed instructions and tests for checking results.

- **html** copies of the completed projects are located in the folder *HTMLs*
- **pdf** copies of the completed projects are located in the folder *PDFs*

*Note*: Much of the content in these files, especially that found in markdwon cells, is not my original work.
